The homepage and the manager panel try to explain themselves, but expect a little bit of roughness~

The overlay generator is a useful tool to use with the stage manager:

[gunjs](https://gun.eco/) is the underlying network framework, making simple stage manager peer-to-peer and free. It uses a couple relay servers that can be changed for new ones in case they go down.

Made by me :)
